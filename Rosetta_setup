The following document describes a set of instructions recommended for MAC users in order to set up and compile Rosetta after downloading

## Link for full instructions for setup of latest version of Rosetta:
 https://www.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/getting_started/Getting-Started#local-installation-and-use-of-rosetta



## A common error when compiling/building rosetta after installing it is: python No such file or directory
## to fix this, we need to install homebrew, then pyenv

## install homebrew with the following command, 
  $ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" ## it will ask for your user password

##  Install pyenv with brew to manage different Python versions:
  brew install pyenv

## install python through pyenv  #It is recommended to avoid using python version 3.12 as it is misssing an important "imp" module
  pyenv install 3.8.13 ## installs recommended python version for mac users
  pyenv global 3.8.13  ## sets python version as global one 
## Add 
  eval "$(pyenv init --path)" 
#to ~/.zprofile (or ~/.bash_profile or ~/.zshrc, whichever you need)


## After these actions, now we will try to compile Rosetta 

    First untar/uncompress your downloaded copy of the code
      tar -xvzf Rosetta[releasenumber].tar.gz

    Next, navigate to the source directory: 
      cd main/source

    ## Rosetta uses SCons as a compile assistant. You will likely need to download and install this first.

    ## The basic compilation command is 
        ./scons.py -j<number_of_processors_to_use> mode=release bin.
    ## Replace with a number one processor fewer than your computer has. Expect compilation to take a while (hours on one processor).
