## The basis of these commands are to produce a "score" file which contains numeric scores on different energy measures of the protein

We can pass a list of PDBs calledÂ pdblist, which contains one path to PDB per line (space separated PDBs work, but they cannot be comma or semi-colon separated) like this:
input_files/1qys.pdb
